# 🧪 Test Assignment: Long Division Simulator

## ✏️ Task

Implement a system to simulate manual long division (like it's done on paper) and format the result as a human-readable string.

- You can use either hardcoded input or read values using Scanner.
- Only integer division is needed (no floating-point or decimal support).
- The output must preserve all spaces, indentation, and underscores exactly like in classic long division notation.

## ✅ Example

Input values:
* Dividend: 1823000002
* Divisor: 13

Expected output:

_1823000002│13
 13        │---------
 –        │140230769

       _122

## 🔧 Hints

- Structure your solution with OOP principals.
- You may create helper classes to store intermediate steps.
- Focus on correct logic and formatting of the division process.
